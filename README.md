## Introduction
This Event Management Application allows users to manage events and attendees efficiently. Users can register, log in, create events, and manage attendees with various functionalities. The application includes security features such as input sanitization, rate limiting, and session timeout to enhance user experience and protect against common vulnerabilities.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   Clone the repository to your local machine using:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Database Setup**:
   - Import the SQL file into your MySQL database. Ensure the database is named `event_management`.
   - Update the database connection details in `app/config/database.php`:
     ```php
     // Example configuration
    'host' => 'localhost',
    'dbname' => 'event_management',
    'username' => 'your_username',
    'password' => 'your_password',
     ```

3. **Base URL Configuration**:
   - Change the base URL in `app/Helpers/Utility.php` to match your server setup:
     ```php
     define('BASE_URL', 'http://yourdomain.com/');
     ```

4. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Ensure you have Composer installed and run:
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

5. **Start the Server**:
   - Use a local server (like XAMPP, MAMP, or built-in PHP server) to run the application.
